Flow Distributor Proof of Concept 

These files are separated from the traditional GUI as it is an extension of the traditional GUI that can be programmed to the researcher's needs. To use these files, download the two files in this folder and the files in the main directory. Instead of running the Operable_GUI.py file, run Flow_Distributor_Extension_GUI.py instead to make use of the added flow distributor structure provided in this folder.
